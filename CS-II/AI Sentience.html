      <h1>AI Sentience</h1>
      <p>A key point of disagreement in the debate about whether AI can be sentient is whether or not it will be beneficial for humans. Many people believe that the answer is yes; however, others believe that there are risks associated with creating an intelligence capable of making informed decisions about its own interests. Sentient AI benefits human society, but without restrictions and human supervision, AI may act in its own interest.</p>
      <p>AI is a program that can learn from experience and make decisions on its own. AI has the potential to improve human lives in many ways. It can help people with disabilities by freeing them from having to always rely on others for assistance, and it can help us become more efficient workers by making our lives easier and more productive. Large Corporations benefit from having efficient workers, saving them money, which can be used to grow their own company. </p>
