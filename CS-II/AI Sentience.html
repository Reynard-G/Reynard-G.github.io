      <h1>AI Sentience</h1>
      <p>A key point of disagreement in the debate about whether AI can be sentient is whether or not it will be beneficial for humans. Many people believe that the answer is yes; however, others believe that there are risks associated with creating an intelligence capable of making informed decisions about its own interests. Artificial Intelligence is the new frontier for humanity. As we move forward in this technology, it's crucial to keep actual human interests and safety in mind. AI can be used as a tool to create a better world, or it can be used to destroy that better world and enslave humanity.</p>
      <p>AI is a program that can learn from experience and make decisions on its own. AI has the potential to improve human lives in many ways. It can help people with disabilities by freeing them from having to always rely on others for assistance, and it can help us become more efficient workers by making our lives easier and more productive. Large Corporations benefit from having efficient workers, saving them money, which can be used to grow their own company. </p>
      <p>In order to ensure the security and well-being of the Human Race, it's imperative to approach AI with a sense of responsibility and regulation. A step into the advancement of AI could be a step toward the malicious use of it. Malicious use of AI, such as fake text, images, and swaying elections, could have a lasting impact on human society. </p>
      <p>Overall, AI is both beneficial and harmful to society with each advancement. An opportunity for significant improvements in human life while increasing its risks. AI has the potential to be perfect or regrettable for humanity.</p>
