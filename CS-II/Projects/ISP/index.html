	I will be doing the backend of the model scheduler and focusing on making a
	sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithm will be focused on giving a list of
	available classes for the user to select based on the classes they have
	already selected. This would remove any confusion on which classes would be
	available to them. Another aspect I would be focusing on would be the
	efficiency of the algorithm and its reliability to give the user their
	available classes. It would also be necessary to make it algorithm organize
	the data of available classes so that the fontend could easily read the output
	of the algorithm.
