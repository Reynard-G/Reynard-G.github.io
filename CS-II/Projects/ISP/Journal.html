	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> This week, we were fixing bugs related to assigning classes
	a semester through "S1+S2", etc. This was important due to the database having 2 classes of privilege
	period with both having "S1+S2" which caused an unnecessary duplication of classes.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> I experienced some scheduling challenges this week due
	to some of my classes having assessments in the coming days. I had less time to work on the project
	in class but I was able to help my classmates understand the issue and have a potential fix soon.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> There weren't many interpersonal challenges amongst
	the team as the Model Scheduler was essentially complete, thus people were taking their time
	on finishing up their assigned tasks.
      </p>
      <p>

	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> This week, our ISP was completed and launched to students
	just in time for arena scheduling. This was a relatively quiet week and everyone was burnt out
	after rushing to complete the ISP in time.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> As we finished our ISP at the deadline, there were no
	scheduling challenges during this week. 
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> There was controversy in the discord server when a
	student cloned the Model Scheduler repository and purposefully removed the login system. This
	was a major interpersonal challenge was most of us were confused as how they got access to
	the classess database and mad that out hard work was stripped from us without any credit.

	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> During this week, we were working on completely finishing
	up our Model Scheduler for launch. Some challenges we encountered this week was figuring out the
	backend of storing schedules per device and the possibility of adding mobile support this close
	to the deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> Although major parts of the ISP were completed, there were
	a few minor bugs that prevented the smooth experience of scheduling classes. One such bug was
	that classes that were scheduled near to privilege periods received different restrictions when
	dragged in a different order.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> Some arguments occured in the discord server due to
	the pressure of the deadline closing in. This was quickly resolved as we all agreed that it was
	important to work on the project with the deadline especially close.

      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> This week was mainly about prepping the Model Scheduler
	for the release such as testing & bug fixing. A challenge I had was creating a new release
	branch with limited permissions and a release tag for each official release of the Model
	Scheduler.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> A major scheduling challenge I faced was scheduler
	bugs such as classes being dragged out do not drag its other semester. This was important
	due to the fact that its local storage did indeed remove the other semester but did not
	remove the div in the scheduling box leading to more conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> As the release date for the Model Scheduler
	closed in, our ISP discord server was active with bugs and features that needed to be fixed.
	There were no major interpersonal challenges between members as everyone was hard at work
	fixing individual parts of the scheduler.

      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> The work for this week has been quite challenging, but we
	have been able to address the issues we have encountered such as porting over Brett's scheduler
	design. We have made significant progress in terms of styling the scheduler page, as well as
	simplifying the class selector code and adjusting the color scheme for the light/dark mode CSS.
	Despite facing some difficulties, we were able to overcome these obstacles and continue with the project.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> There were no major scheduling challenges this week and
	the absence of major grades allowed me to work on the project.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> This week was mostly quiet in the ISP discord server
	so there were no interpersonal challenges for the team.

      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> This week, I was assigned on styling the scheduler page.
	As well as simplifying my class selector code, I made changes to the color scheme of the light/dark
	mode CSS. Although I had some challenges finding the variable used for certain backgrounds, I
	was able to tackle those problems.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> There were no major scheduling challenges for me besides
	having two quizzes this week. On some days I found it hard to be able to work on the Model Scheduler
	due to studying for quizzes and homework from multiple AP courses.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> There were no major interpersonal challenges for
	me but I observed some challenges within the discord server for our ISP. Due to the multitude
	of people working on the same project without effective communicatin, some members worked on
	the same parts resulting in the team having to choose one and and overall waste of time.
	This was significant because it resulted into declining motivation due to people's efforts
	being put to waste.

      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> This week we encountered a wide variety of challenges
	regardingour project. Prior to our MVP presentations, we didn't have many working features on
	the front end that have now been fixed and currently are being fixed. Some of our terminals
	have crashed a couple of times, but we believe we have gotten this fixed. For any prospective
	additions to the model scheduler, we will work together in order to ensure the completion
	of all necessary components needed for this project.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> By far our biggest challenge was scheduling. This week
	had split up the work between all group members. Due to different schedules this has continued
	to harm our project because it has hindered our overall productivity with many having to
	also complete other individuals tasks. It believe assigning tasks at the beginning of the
	week for everyone is a good idea, but it is also important of all individuals communicate
	any issues that may get in the way of not completing assigned tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> Our interpersonal challenges mostly comprise of
	our inability to communicate. Other than that many of us have been able to work on the
	project without any issues.

      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> A technical challenge we encountered was finding a
	way to properly store a user's credentials using bcrypt & SHA256. This was accomplished using
	packages for hashing the user's email & password.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> We experienced a challenge trying to get basic
	functionality the different website designs such as draggable classes and storing current
	data of selected classes. This was overcomed eventually by learning multiple aspects of the
	website and getting to know how HTML + JS worked together.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> I have not encountered any interpersonal challenges
	this week.

	<strong>16-Jan-2023:</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> We had to choose between different design layouts
	for our scheduler. This was challening due to some designs looking good aestheticaly but
	impractical and over the top. We decided to keep all the designs and implementing them
	later on once the backend was done for pages such as the login & light/dark mode.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> I have not encountered any scheduling challenges this
	week.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> As a team, we had communication issues regarding
	who was assigned a part of the website. This came up when multiple members were working on
	the same assignment until the first person was done only then the rest were forced to
	scrap their work. This was overcomed by an effort to communicate more in a discord
	server.
      </p>
      <h3 style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">
	<strong>9-Jan-2023:</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
	<strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> We had to plan our database design with the
	required columns for class data. This was challenging due to last year's schedule being
	changed during Arena Scheduling planning resulting in everyone's schedule being wiped.
	This was overcomed by my solution of running a SQL script checking everyone's stored
	schedules for invalid class placements which would be executed everytime a user would
	visit the website.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> As the Model Scheduler Team is split up into
	classes, we resulted to using Discord as our communications. This gave us an effective
	and easy way to communicate rather than using Github Issues for our problems.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> Conflicts arose as team members complained
	about the amount of issues opened in the repository. The amount of issues opened on Github
	was relative to the assignment of 3 issues opened per person as we were a 20 member
	team. This was explained to the members complaining and the issue was resolved through
	discord.

      <p>
	<strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> Getting work done as a team can be a
	challenging process, as it requires effective communication and collaboration
	between the members of the team. Individual team members must be able to
	clearly define their roles and responsibilities, and the team as a whole must
	be able to work together to achieve the group's goals. Moreover, the team must
	be able to work together to resolve any conflicts or disagreements in an
	efficient and effective manner.

	<strong>Development Engineer:</strong> A development engineer is responsible for
	the design, testing and maintenance of software systems. They create code used in
	programming applications as well as write scripts to allow a machine or system
	to complete tasks autonomously. Specifically they are tasked with designing
	programs that meet certain criteria set out by either their team leader or an
	external stakeholder such as a customer who wishes particular features
	implemented in an application they have commissioned work on. Development
	engineers often need good problem-solving skills when breaking down complex
	problems into simpler pieces which can be coded more easily, along with high
	levels of concentration while debugging any existing errors present within
	existing products prior to launch dates being met successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>QA Engineer:</strong> Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers typically review
	product requirements before implementation begins evaluating all technical aspects
	involved throughout the production process ensuring accuracy between what was
	promised initially during conversations around specifications versus output
	delivered upon completion date milestones achieved/met going forward QAs also
	document processes deemed necessary from release notes associated if required
	additionally setting up test environments conducive towards project success
	incorporating automated playbacks too this enables them study user stories
	feedback received streamlining contributions whilst delivering expected
	results.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Project Manager:</strong> The role of a Project Manager involves taking
	responsibility for leading teams through each stage within the life cycle from
	initiation through delivery to closure; these include defining goals and
	objectives related to the scope planned at the start, discussing possible
	solutions, implementing strategies, determining resources needed, budgeting,
	tracking progress, reporting status updates, providing clear and concise
	communication, liaising effectively with all relevant groups engaged, managing
	change requests, risks, issues, enforcing deadlines, etc. Furthermore, given
	its extremely vital nature, collaboration involving multiple personnel
	linkages is indispensible and critically increases the chances of succeeding
	including smoother workflow and timeliness.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Product Manager:</strong> A product manager is responsible for creating
	and overseeing the delivery of a specific software or hardware product. They are
	tasked with defining the roadmap, setting goals and objectives, managing
	resources, coordinating development efforts across multiple departments such
	as engineering, marketing and sales teams to ensure successful launches of
	products on time while meeting customer requirements. Additionally they will
	often work closely with organizers in order to facilitate efficient project
	completion within agreed upon parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Release Engineer:</strong> The Release Engineer is responsible for the
	successful deployment of software products into production. This includes
	creating and managing build plans, automating processes where possible to
	streamline deployments, coordinating with different organizers in order to
	have a smooth release process from development through testing/validation up
	until it reaches its end users. They are also tasked with making sure that any
	updates or new features being added do not affect previous versions negatively
	nor disrupt overall system stability.
