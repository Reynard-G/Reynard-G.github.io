	<b>Technical Challenges:</b> A technical challenge we encountered was finding a way to
	properly store a user's credentials using bcrypt & SHA256. This was accomplished using
	packages for hashing the user's email & password.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Scheduling Challenges:</b> We experienced a challenge trying to get basic functionality
	the different website designs such as draggable classes and storing current data of
	selected classes. This was overcomed eventually by learning multiple aspects of the
	website and getting to know how HTML + JS worked together.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Interpersonal Challenges:</b> I have not encountered any interpersonal challenges this
	week.
      </p>

	<b>Technical Challenges:</b> We had to choose between different design layouts for
	our scheduler. This was challening due to some designs looking good aestheticaly but
	impractical and over the top. We decided to keep all the designs and implementing them
	later on once the backend was done for pages such as the login & light/dark mode.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Scheduling Challenges:</b> I have not encountered any scheduling challenges this
	week.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Interpersonal Challenges:</b> As a team, we had communication issues regarding who
	was assigned a part of the website. This came up when multiple members were working on
	the same assignment until the first person was done only then the rest were forced to
	scrap their work. This was overcomed by an effort to communicate more in a discord
	server.
      </p>
      <h3 style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">
	<b>9-Jan-2023:</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
	<b>Technical Challenges:</b> We had to plan our database design with the required
	columns for class data. This was challenging due to last year's schedule being
	changed during Arena Scheduling planning resulting in everyone's schedule being wiped.
	This was overcomed by my solution of running a SQL script checking everyone's stored
	schedules for invalid class placements which would be executed everytime a user would
	visit the website.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Scheduling Challenges:</b> As the Model Scheduler Team is split up into classes,
	we resulted to using Discord as our communications. This gave us an effective
	and easy way to communicate rather than using Github Issues for our problems.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Interpersonal Challenges:</b> Conflicts arose as team members complained about
	the amount of issues opened in the repository. The amount of issues opened on Github
	was relative to the assignment of 3 issues opened per person as we were a 20 member
	team. This was explained to the members complaining and the issue was resolved through
	discord.
      </p>

	<b>Interpersonal Challenges:</b> Getting work done as a team can be a
	challenging process, as it requires effective communication and collaboration
	between the members of the team. Individual team members must be able to
	clearly define their roles and responsibilities, and the team as a whole must
	be able to work together to achieve the group's goals. Moreover, the team must
	be able to work together to resolve any conflicts or disagreements in an
	efficient and effective manner.

	<b>Development Engineer:</b> A development engineer is responsible for the
	design, testing and maintenance of software systems. They create code used in
	programming applications as well as write scripts to allow a machine or system
	to complete tasks autonomously. Specifically they are tasked with designing
	programs that meet certain criteria set out by either their team leader or an
	external stakeholder such as a customer who wishes particular features
	implemented in an application they have commissioned work on. Development
	engineers often need good problem-solving skills when breaking down complex
	problems into simpler pieces which can be coded more easily, along with high
	levels of concentration while debugging any existing errors present within
	  existing products prior to launch dates being met successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>QA Engineer:</b> Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers typically review product
	requirements before implementation begins evaluating all technical aspects
	involved throughout the production process ensuring accuracy between what was
	promised initially during conversations around specifications versus output
	delivered upon completion date milestones achieved/met going forward QAs also
	document processes deemed necessary from release notes associated if required
	additionally setting up test environments conducive towards project success
	incorporating automated playbacks too this enables them study user stories
	feedback received streamlining contributions whilst delivering expected
	results.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Project Manager:</b> The role of a Project Manager involves taking
	responsibility for leading teams through each stage within the life cycle from
	initiation through delivery to closure; these include defining goals and
	objectives related to the scope planned at the start, discussing possible
	solutions, implementing strategies, determining resources needed, budgeting,
	tracking progress, reporting status updates, providing clear and concise
	communication, liaising effectively with all relevant groups engaged, managing
	change requests, risks, issues, enforcing deadlines, etc. Furthermore, given
	its extremely vital nature, collaboration involving multiple personnel
	linkages is indispensible and critically increases the chances of succeeding
	including smoother workflow and timeliness.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Product Manager:</b> A product manager is responsible for creating and
	overseeing the delivery of a specific software or hardware product. They are
	tasked with defining the roadmap, setting goals and objectives, managing
	resources, coordinating development efforts across multiple departments such
	as engineering, marketing and sales teams to ensure successful launches of
	products on time while meeting customer requirements. Additionally they will
	often work closely with organizers in order to facilitate efficient project
	completion within agreed upon parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Release Engineer:</b> The Release Engineer is responsible for the
	successful deployment of software products into production. This includes
	creating and managing build plans, automating processes where possible to
	streamline deployments, coordinating with different organizers in order to
	have a smooth release process from development through testing/validation up
	until it reaches its end users. They are also tasked with making sure that any
	updates or new features being added do not affect previous versions negatively
	nor disrupt overall system stability.
