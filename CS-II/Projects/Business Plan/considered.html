    <h1>ISP Acceptance</h1>
    <div class="essay">
      <p><b>Proposal #1 by Timothy Andresen</b> - The project made by this group is impractical and would be detrimental to the rest of society. School buses already leave at time to where students get to class on time. Turning the lights green for only school bus routes would be incredibly inefficient for almost everyone else on the road. Overall, the idea is not well thought out and should not be implemented.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #2 by Austin Dlugosch</b> - This caught my eye because it seemed very unique. But I do not want to do this because it doesn't seem like something that people would buy. A spinning TV seems like it would take up more space than it would save. This seems like a gimmick that isn’t really needed, as you can just turn the tv manually if you really need to rotate it. Additionally, this product does not seem like something that requires computer science.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #3 by Benjamin Haines</b> - Their group project idea is to make a city planner calendar that is more accessible. This would ensure that more people are more aware of the events that are happening in their community. Their main competitor is google and I think that anything they come up with, would be overshadowed by how  gigantic google is. I think a better solution to this would be to make the already existing website better or make a new one on google. Additionally I don’t think this is the correct problem they should be addressing. The problem is that people don’t care enough to find out about events in their city and go to them, not that people care and they can’t find out about the events.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #4 by Heng-Yi-Lee</b> - This idea seems good, but it is very difficult to implement. Also, companies such as Porsche and BMW have already started to use this technology in their cars so it is only a matter of implementing that same technology on a bigger scale. Idea seems good on the surface but it is already in the market which makes it unoriginal and a very simple project with the right resources.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #5 by Farhan Ishraque</b> - While a good idea, it's a very competitive market. There's already veterans in this industry like iBUYPower and NZXT Build. Additionally, they have no unique idea to compete in this market. The proposal also requires high startup costs for collecting parts and start selling. Also, teens interested in PC gaming are more likely to buy parts on their own and build the pc themselves.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #6 by Chris Carter</b> - I rejected this as I did not really have an idea of what kind of project that it is. I would’ve liked a proposal plan page like the other pages that I could actually view through and consider this project. But due to that not existing, I decided to reject it.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #7 by Evan Bowerman</b> - Similar to the reasons I rejected Brook's project plan, I rejected the project proposal by Evan. While it is a very good application and program, and could potentially be successful, the software behind it is not very challenging and to make it interesting will be hard.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #8 by Brook Asnake</b> - I liked the core plan behind this project, as well as the idea. To make a simple program which would be able to help you schedule and plan out your day is a very good idea. But to me it feels too mundane and easy, which is why I rejected it.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #9 by Adheesh Katru</b> - I did consider this business plan heavily as the core mission behind this plan is fundamentally a good mission. Intended on making people healthy and getting healthy groceries to homes around the world. But the reason I rejected it is due to the immense competition to the plan due to the existence of Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods and their home delivery programs.</p>
      <p><b>Proposal #10 by Reynard Gunawan</b> - I heavily considered this plan because of the complexity and how challenging it was. Our thought process was to use an API that would do the heavy-lifting for us while we make requests to that API based of customer input. There seems to be a challenge with some people not knowing how to use an API but luckily, there are plenty of documentations explaining how to use their own API's. I feel that it is possible for us to do this project with time and patience.</p>
