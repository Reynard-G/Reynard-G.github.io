    <h1>ISP Proposal</h1>
    <div class="essay">
      <p><b>Identity</b> - The project idea is essentially a filtering system for people to be able to purchase clothes depending on their physiological needs and personal preferences. This filtering system would be hosted on a public website.</p>
      <p><b>Problem</b> - The problem here is simple; most people are not fashion gurus nor do they know a lot about it, for most everyday normal people online shopping for clothes is near impossible. With the hundreds of different websites, each person having their own physiological needs and preferences, it can feel overwhelming to shop for clothes online.</p>
      <p><b>Solution</b> - Thus, the solution is a filtering system which can filter clothes and give a display/list to people depending on the following criteria; physiological needs such as height, weight, and gender, as well as personal preferences such as fashion choices, preferred clothing companies, budget, etc and display a list based on these criterias.</p>
      <p><b>Target Market</b> - Generally everyone that is not inclined with fashion, this can be a great product for those who live a very busy lifestyle and do not have time to shop, those who are unable to afford expensive clothing that they like, those who simply can not be bothered to go through with the time it takes to pick out clothes that they like or go shopping for such.</p>
      <p><b>Competition</b> - The primary competition here would be wholesale retailer websites, and brick and mortar stores. Websites due to them having the ability to utilize filtering systems like the ones weâ€™re designing, and brick and mortar stores due to them having a large collection of items that people can walk in and shop for.</p>
      <p><b>Revenue Streams</b> - There would be two primary revenue streams, the first being from advertising on the website and the second being commissions from companies for our filtering system leading to those websites.</p>
      <p><b>Marketing Activities</b> - Marketing would be done primarily through internet advertisement, and word of mouth as these are the cheapest and most effective options possible for us.</p>
      <p><b>Expenses</b> - The primary expenses would be keeping the website online with server costs, a secondary expense being salaries of employees as well as sustenance.</p>
      <p><b>Team and Key Roles</b> - Reynard Gunawan; who will be the Chief Software Developer, managing the software development side of the project. Kevin Li; who will be responsible for developing the software alongside being the research lead for the project. Avanish Jeendru; who will be responsible for developing software alongside being the Chief Financial Officer responsible for all financial aspects of the project. Isaac Pandyan; who will be Chief Communications Officer, responsible for communications within the project. MD Raeed; who will be the Chief Executive Officer of the project, alongside being the Chief Marketing Officer.</p>
      <p><b>Milestones</b> - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13NHJtR3wk3cVOgDCqtoNC1au--o0aU2ajApNGPeyFBk/edit?usp=sharing">Gantt Chart</a></p>
