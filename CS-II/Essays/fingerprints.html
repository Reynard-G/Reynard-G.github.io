	Fingerprints are an essential aspect of the internet; they ensure that the information you're getting is legitimate. One way to mask your valuable internet 
	information is Certificate Authorities (CA). They put their reputation as a Certificate Authority on the line by digitally signing the site's security 
	certificate, which contains an assertion of its identity. Another way to disguise your internet information is by going to a HTTPS website (Padlock). Two 
	fundamental reasons for utilizing a HTTPS connection when visiting a website are to enhance a user's security and privacy. While HTTPS connections are 
	primarily secure, corporations, schools, and other organizations have responded to this "loss of visibility" by deploying HTTPS Proxy Appliances. HTTPS Proxy 
	Appliances allow these organizations to examine HTTPS traffic requested by individuals on their network, which circumvents a user's guarantee of Internet 
	browser privacy. This brings up the question, does your school/government/ISP have a right to eavesdrop on your communication? No, this violates the 
	fundamental right to privacy and may be used by telecom networks to sell your data. Although your organization may be monitoring your network, you are still 
	protected. Examining a website's SSL certificate can produce a "cryptographic hash." Changing one bit within a certificate can result in the average 
	alteration of half of the fingerprint's hash bits. Although hashing sounds like a good idea, there are some flawed ones, such as MD5 & SHA-1. A good hash has 
	collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance. Collision Resistance is how hard it is to find two messages (message digest) that 
	hash the same. Preimage Resistance is the difficulty of finding another message that hashes the same when given a hash. Second preimage resistance is when 
	you're given a message and it is infeasible to find a second input with the same output as the given input.

	Devices connected to the internet are susceptible to attacks. An SSL interception is an attack used to intercept, block or allow traffic to and from websites. 
	Anti-Malware software can assist you in detecting SSL interceptions and removing them. Avoid clicking on spam emails, ads, and visiting non-HTTPS websites. 
	Similar to an SSL interception attack, a MitM attack intercepts communications between two parties. The attacker can monitor, collect, or manipulate all 
	information sent between the parties. Some people may think they are tracked by checking a site's certificate fingerprints. Amazon and Google, for example, 
	have several certificates to make it easier to obtain and manage them, but their security is not compromised; this is known as a false-positive. Another 
	component of this is a false-negative, which occurs when you believe you are not being monitored when you are.
