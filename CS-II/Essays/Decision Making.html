	When embarking on a coding project, it is key that decision-making processes
	are free from bias. Unfair assessment of data can lead to inaccurate results
	or conclusions and impede the success of the team's efforts in completing
	their task efficiently. Unfortunately, biases can easily creep into our
	thought processes if we are not aware of how they work and how to avoid
	them, even though some may be subconsciously present without us noticing at
	all. Below, I will explain five different types of potential cognitive
	biases that teams should watch out for when making important decisions
	related to their ISPs: Confirmation Bias, Groupthink, Attribution Error,
	Status Quo Bias, and In-Group Bias.
      </p>
      <p>
	Confirmation bias is a common tendency for people to only consider
	information that confirms their prior beliefs while disregarding evidence
	that contradicts those views; this often leads individuals (or groups) down
	an illogical path, as opposed to staying open-minded about alternative
	possibilities in solving complex problems within a given time frame. For
	example, let's imagine you're working with your development team to
	brainstorm ideas for fixing a bug within an existing codebase, but every
	idea proposed by someone who disagrees with yours gets quickly discounted
	because "it won't work". This could become especially problematic if
	confirmation bias continues unchecked, preventing group members from seeing
	other options available, leading them further away from finding a successful
	solution and shortening the timeline allocated to complete the goal set
	forth initially.
      </p>
      <p>
	Groupthink occurs whenever there is pressure placed on individual members not
	to speak up against majority opinion due to fear of repercussions such as
	being ostracized or dismissed entirely from discussion. Unfortunately, what
	usually ends up happening is that the collective thinking process becomes
	limited in scope, and the original intention of creating a tunnel vision so
	everyone focuses solely on a particular aspect of the project is lost. Instead
	of addressing each problem objectively and openly discussing possible
	solutions together until the best answer is found collaboratively as a unit,
	people go off independently to pursue their own interests regardless of the
	outcome others might face afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
	Attribution error occurs when attributing a cause to a certain event even
	though none exists. This means assigning the wrong person blame for a
	situation based on personal judgments or judgement calls made incorrectly
	(Healy). It is attributed to another factor where no reasonable connection
	between the two exists whatsoever, such as unfair criticism of a fellow
	coworker for writing poor quality code and then blaming their inexperience
	level with the tech language used to address the issue itself, thus diverting
	attention onto something else to distract onlookers from the reality that the
	more likely culprit had nothing to do with the actual circumstances
	surrounding the case (Healy). That is why it is essential to always take extra
	care in formulating an accurate narrative before jumping to a definitive
	conclusion that assigns responsibility to a specific source too hastily, just
	to satisfy an immediate need to point the finger at a scapegoat or handy
	target for supposed wrongdoing committed elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
	Status quo bias refers to the prevailing behavior exhibited by most people
	to maintain the current state of affairs despite whatever changes the
	external environment presents over a period of time. Whether these benefits
	the organization or detriment the end user experience does not matter as
	long as the status remains the same (Cherry). The general direction taken goes
	unchallenged, otherwise known as a "laziness" attitude since there is a lack
	of motivation to drive change. Anything that already works well enough now
	risks losing any gains achieved so far on the journey, which would
	ultimately result in a monumental waste of resources expended to get the
	venture underway and begin to start again from somewhere near zero.
	Experiments should follow, making sure to weigh the pros and cons wisely to
	help achieve the desired objectives, resulting in reaching goals quicker and
	easier.
      </p>
      <p>
	Finally, in-group bias is a type of social prejudice that results from
	favoring the opinions and viewpoints held by members close to our circle due
	to physical similarities or shared behavioral characteristics (Decision Lab).
	This can lead group dynamics astray, as any suggestion made outside this inner
	bubble might be rejected, even if backed up with solid evidence, because it
	does not align with their preexisting line of thinking. Therefore, giving
	preferential treatment to ideas only originating within one's own special
	clique will impede progress and create an atmosphere where minority voices are
	completely dismissed without being seriously considered for the potential
	value they may bring to the chosen path.
