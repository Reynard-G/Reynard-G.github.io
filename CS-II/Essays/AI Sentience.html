    <h1>AI Sentience</h1>
    <p>
      A key point of disagreement in the debate about whether AI can be sentient is whether or not it will be beneficial for humans. Many people believe that the <br>
      answer is yes; however, others believe that there are risks associated with creating an intelligence capable of making informed decisions about its own <br>
      interests. Artificial Intelligence is the new frontier for humanity. As we move forward in this technology, it's crucial to keep actual human interests and <br>
      safety in mind. AI can be used as a tool to create a better world, or it can be used to destroy that better world and enslave humanity. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      AI is a program that can learn from experience and make decisions on its own. AI has the potential to improve human lives in many ways. It can help people <br>
      with disabilities by freeing them from having to always rely on others for assistance, and it can help us become more efficient workers by making our lives <br>
      easier and more productive. Large Corporations benefit from having efficient workers, saving them money, which can be used to grow their own company. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to ensure the security and well-being of the Human Race, it's imperative to approach AI with a sense of responsibility and regulation. A step into <br>
      the advancement of AI could be a step toward the malicious use of it. Malicious use of AI, such as fake text, images, and swaying elections, could have a <br>
      lasting impact on human society. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, AI is both beneficial and harmful to society with each advancement. An opportunity for significant improvements in human life while increasing its <br>
      risks. AI has the potential to be perfect or regrettable for humanity. <br>
