      <p>
	Keeping a Digital Portfolio is important because it shows your growth throughout your highschool
	career and can serve as your main portfolio website and a resume after highschool. It represents
	a student's individuality and skills for academic and professional opportunities. Once a student
	graduates high school, they graduate with more than a transcript, leaving school with a lifetime
	tool. Digital Portflios can also act as a resumeand help students stand out from the competition
	and establish professionalism while providing evidence of accomplishments and skills. That is why
	Digital Portfolio is important to me.
