      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>Keeping a Digital Portfolio is important because it shows your growth throughout your highschool</p>
      <p>career and can serve as your main portfolio website and a resume after highschool. A well-designed</p>
      <p>portfolio can also represent a developer's skills and show past projects so that a future client knows</p>
      <p>what they are working with. That is why Digital Portfolio is important to me.</p>
