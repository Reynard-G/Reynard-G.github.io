    <h3>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h3>
    <div class="essay">
      <p>
	Recommendation algorithms are systems that are designed to suggest items
	that best fit their consumers. These algorithms can be found from social media to streaming
	apps and suggest what ads are relevant based on the data they collect about you. An example
	of this would be Google's use of search data to find products that may interest you through
	their Google Ads product. Recommendation algorithms can be used to provide a personalized
	user experience as they can constantly adapt a user's suggestions based on thier activities.

    <h3>The Feedback Loop</h3>
    <div class="essay">
      <p>
	The Feedback Loop is a way of collecting information based on the number of times a user
	interacts with content. It is a self-reinforcing algorithm that learns the type of content
	you engage with and progressively gets more accurate with the more data it has on the user.
	Over time, users are exposed to content or products that align with their interests which
	creates a custom curated experience on the platform for the user.
      </p>

    <h3>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h3>
    <div class="essay">
      <p>
	The algorithms utilized on many platforms are geared towards creating high engagement to
	increase time spent on their app. As a result, consipiracy theories often end up getting
	pushed to the top of recommendation lists due to them being engaging by nature. Even though
	it may lead people away from the truth, people may accept it as fact in terms of their beliefs
	algorithms prioritize boosting revenue from ads by increasing user engagement with their
	platform above all else which can cause misinformation to spread throughout society
	inadvertently.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Platform Incentives</h3>
    <div class="essay">
      <p>
	Since platforms control what ads get seen, they may prioritize content that pockets the
	most money possible for them, even if it lacks accuracy. This may create an environment
	of false information for users which can spread under the assumption of the truth. Platforms
	can also create multiple tiers of ads that have benefits such as unskippable for a duration
	or unskippable at all. This can be dangerous because not all content is truthful and companies
	may be only interested in profits.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Potential for Exploitation</h3>
    <div class="essay">
      <p>
	It is relatively easy to manipulate information and promote it through ad services. They often
	advertise false facts or deceive you into purchasing products that do not do their intended
	function. Bad actors can take advantage of this and potentially profit of it just by artificially
	boosting the promotion by purchasing ads or using bots to boost engagement in order for it to
	reach to real audiences. In conclusion, it is important to be aware of how recommendation
	algorithms work as well as how they can be manipulated for illicit purposes.
