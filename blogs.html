	    Bringing an end to the BYOD policy will be detrimental to students. Some classes require programs
	    that do not work in school computers or simply do not have enough processing power for a smooth
	    experience such as VSCode. This restricts students abilities in a school environment such as disabling
	    a Chromebook's linux environment to download programs or disabling Chrome's developer tools which
	    prevents students from debugging their websites. The chromebooks provided by the school aren't
	    powerful by any means and most are inferior to the devices students bring from home. Another issue
	    would be tracking students through the use of programs such as GoGuardian. This would allow the 
	    school to track every action a student makes in their chromebook which is very invasive way of
	    monitoring students. The implementation of ending the BYOD policy brings down one of our freedoms
	    in a learning environment tangled in technology.
